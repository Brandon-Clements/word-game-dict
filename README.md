# word-game-dict
A text file dictionary for use with word games

We start with the ASpell dictonary and apply various filters to remove
abbriviations and words with numbers or punctuation. We also remove
words that would be too short or long.

If you would like to use this to generate your own word list it is
recommended to clone this and modify the python file.
